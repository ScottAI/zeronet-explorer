Zeronet Explorer — TrustLess Republic™

________________________________________________________________________________

Zeronet Explorer is your personal guide onto the decentralized web and beyond.

Zer0net delivers you greater information freedom, identity protection and data privacy than the Internet, without the creepy funk of the Darkweb. You're welcome!

Throwback 20 years, it's 1998 again, and Internet Explorer just took 3½ minutes to download your first web page off a private web server halfway around the world. Jump back to 2018, and Zeronet Explorer is about to peer you with your first zite off the decentralized web currently swarming your local city. Yeah we know, go on, we'll wait right here...

Zeronet websites, or zites, function more similar to a mobile app than a traditional website. You download & install all the information once, then its becomes extremely fast interacting with the zite.

What is the Zer0net?

"It feels like the Linux version of the WWW. Zero ownership. Zero limits. Zero bulls@#$!"
